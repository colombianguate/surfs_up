- Historically, summer is usually high temperatures. In this case, June and Dec have similar temperatures.

- December which is in the season of winter actually had an mean of 71 as seen above which is great weather not too hot nor not too cold. Surf and ice cream shop will still be substainable.

- June was not hot, it had a minimum of 56 and a maximum of 8, not too far off the maximum of December which was 85.

- There are more temperatures in June recorded than December which could not give the full comparison as needed.

## Summary

June and December will both be great times for the shop. There isn't a difference within the temperatures. Only just a few degrees colder in December, which is suprising because December is usually a colder month. To get more insight on the weather, we could get weather descriptions. The weather descriptions could help as there is only the weather temperature. We could also filter each week in the months so see the rise and fall in temperatures to prepare for unprecedent weather.
